# AI in Population Health  

![](ai_in_health.png){width=50%}
:::

# Introduction

![](ai_intro.png){width=60%}


# Overview

We will explore:

1. **Predicting Health Risks**  
2. **AI and Social Determinants of Health**  
3. **AI for Interventions and Surveillance**  
4. **Ethical Challenges**  



# 1. Predicting Health Risks 🔮

![](ai_predictingRisks.png){width=60%}

**Process**: Data → AI learns patterns → Risk scores → Early intervention

**Goal**: Predict disease before symptoms

---

## 1.1 Example: Heart Attack Prediction

**IBM Watson Health**:

- 90% accuracy predicting heart attacks weeks ahead
- Early identification of high-risk patients

**Benefits**: 

- Individual: Personalized prevention
- Population: Efficient resource allocation

**Key insight**: Prevention upstream, not just treatment



# 2. AI and Social Determinants of Health 🌍

Health is shaped by where people live, work, and play:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Housing
- Food access
- Air pollution
- Walkability
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Neighborhood safety
- Income
- Employment
- Education

**Spatial modeling**: AI analyzes geographic data to find health patterns

**AI advantage**: Combines satellite, GIS, social media, sensors, and demographics

## 2.1 Example: Dengue Fever Forecasting

# 3. AI for Interventions and Surveillance 🎯

**AI helps**:

- Track outbreaks in real-time
- Detect anomalies in surveillance
- Predict hospital demand
- Optimize vaccine distribution

**Transformation**: Manual/slow → Automated/real-time

---

## 3.1 Disease Forecasting and Surveillance

- **Data sources**: EHRs, social media, sensors, mobility data

- **Example**: Google AI predicts COVID-19 cases 2 weeks ahead

- **CDC surveillance**: 
  - Identifies outbreaks
  - tracks spread
  - guides interventions

## 3.2 Case Study: COVID-19

**AI supported pandemic response**:

::: columns
::: column

- Case predictions 2 weeks ahead  
- Contact tracing (including facial recognition with masks)  
- Drug repurposing via deep learning  
- BlueDot predicted spread (air travel + climate)  
- Misinformation detection and control

**Result**: Faster detection and response



# 4. Ethical Challenges ⚖️

**Four major risks**:

1. Bias and discrimination
2. Privacy and surveillance  
3. Transparency ("black box")
4. Global inequity

---

## 4.1 Challenge 1: Algorithmic Bias

- **Problem**: Biased training data → Biased predictions

- **Example**: Skin cancer AI trained on light skin fails on dark skin

> "Inaccurate projections can result in inequitable resource distribution and harm to marginalized communities." — *Olawade et al., 2023*

---

## 4.2 Challenge 2: Privacy and Surveillance




::: columns
::: column


- Re-identification of anonymized data
- Misuse of location tracking
- Insurance discrimination

:::

::: column
<img src="ai_picture4_2.png" style="width:50%; margin-left:40px;">
:::
:::

**Regulations**: HIPAA (US), GDPR (Europe) help but have limits

**Question**: How much surveillance is acceptable?


---


## 4.3 Challenge 3: The Black Box Problem

::: columns
::: column

**Issue**:  
- Deep learning cannot explain decisions  

**Why it matters**:  
- Policymakers need to understand recommendations  
- Public trust requires transparency  

**Solution**: Explainable AI (XAI)

## 4.4 Challenge 4: Global Inequity

**Low-income countries lack**:

- Quality training data
- Computing infrastructure  
- Technical expertise

**Consequence**: Widening health disparities

**Data quality**: "Garbage in, garbage out"



# Summary

**AI helps by**:

- Predicting disease before symptoms
- Understanding SDOH through spatial analysis
- Improving interventions and surveillance

**Must address**:

- Bias, privacy, transparency, equity

**Remember**: AI augments humans, does not replace them

# Discussion Questions

1. Where should AI be used most urgently?

2. Which ethical challenge is most pressing?

3. Should AI models be open-source?

4. What role for communities in AI decisions?
